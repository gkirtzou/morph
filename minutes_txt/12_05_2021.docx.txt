Agenda

 1.
        Summary decomp vs. morph module chairs meeting

→ develop morph module independent of existing docomp/vartrans vocabulary for
dedicated purpose of representing generated morphological language data

  • 
        add disclaimer as in lexicog module: only use morph if you know that
        you are doing

  • 
        as long as both modules are used for different use cases there is no
        problem (no superseding, overlap or incompatibility) - we have to make
        clear for what use case decomp and morph are applicable and that morph
        is more complex

  • 
        no integration of the morph module into decomp/vartrans but keep all
        separate for different use cases (and define them clearly)

  • 
        allows for different views on morphology (morph allows the same view
        but with more granularity than decomp, and also different views)

 2.
        Update and refinement of representation needs

  • 
        representation needs updated on https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/
        wiki/Morphology

  • 
        some information not finished, e.g. language example and required
        vocabulary

  • 
        extend required vocabulary information during 1. evaluation round

N2: keep prefix, suffix, circumfix out of morph module

John: subclass specifications to morph:Affix can be added to the lexinfo
vocabulary if required (https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo)

N5: try to merge with another derivational morphology need

N6: KDictionary property “display” tag to select an ontolex:Form (or Morph)
resource together with ontolex:LexicalEntry - look into TEI lex vocabulary
solution

property that links LexicalEntry to morphs

Nx (new modeling need): ordering: generic ordering with rdf property
insufficient. ordering needs to be explicit for the LexicalEntry and Form
resources that are segmented, LiLa solution: datatype property on derivational
relation with integers (position in rule is 1, 2)
